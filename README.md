# **EVR 628 Assignments and more :)**

**Author:** Lina Arag칩n [linamaragonb\@gmail.com](mailto:linamaragonb@gmail.com){.email}

This repository has been created as part of the EVR 628 course (Introduction to Data Management and Visualization for Environmental Scientists) from the University of Miami. Here, I will upload my unique solutions for the assignments Dr. Juan Carlos Villase침or-Derbez (JC) designed.

## **First assignment**

The first assignment was to create this repository. So, Voila :) !!

When creating the project, I used the "EVR628tools" package designed by Dr. Villase침or-Derbez to make the project structure that will contain everything I will do to achieve each assignment's goal. I used the function create_dirs(), and with this one, I gave the repository the following structure:

-   `data`:

    -   `data/raw`:
    -   `data/processed`:

-   `scripts`:

    -   `scripts/01_processing`:
    -   `scripts/02_analyses`:
    -   `scripts/03_contents`: contains a single file showing the code to create this structure

-   `results`:

    -   `results/img`:
    -   `results/tab`:

The subfolder 03_processing, inside the scripts folder, contains the .qmd file showing the few steps I took for the first assignment.

## **Second assignment**

The second assignment is a bit more fun and interesting than the first one. For this one, we should find a messy dataset and shape it so that we are ready to analyze data and make figures.

I wanted to do something unrelated to my plant ecologist science hat. I have been working a lot analyzing pretty awesome data, so taking a break from that sounded like a great idea. Inspired by one of Dr. Villase침or-Derbez's suggestions, I decided to download the data my Garmin Venu 3S has been collecting since May 9, 2025.
You can find what I did in this [script](scripts/01_processing/clean_garmin_dataset.R).

### **About the data**

***[data/processed/garmin_processed.rds](data/processed/garmin_processed.rds) contains 194 activities (rows) and 42 columns. 
I won't describe the 42 columns, so below are the ones I think will be useful for future analyses.***

- `activity_type` - Character - A unique identifier for each type of activity (i.e., Strenght training, HIIT, Running, among others)
- `date` - Character - A unique identifier for each activity's date and time
- `month` - Character - The month in which the activity happened
- `day` - Character - The day in which the activity happened
- `year` - Character - The year in which the activity happened
- `star_time` - Character - Time of day the activity started
- `specific_info` - Character - A unique identifier for specific information regarding the activity (i.e., place (Coral_Gables))
- `distance` - Numerical - A distance metric for activities like running, walking and hiking
- `distance` - Numerical - The calories burned during the activity
- `time` - Time - The time I spent doing each activity
- `avg_hr` - Numerical - Average HR during the activity
- `max_hr` - Numerical - Maximum HR during the activity
- `avg_hr` - Numerical - Average HR during the activity
- `avg_speed` - Numerical - Average speed during the activity
- `max_speed` - Numerical - Average speed during the activity
- `total_ascent` - Numerical - Total ascent during the activity
- `total_descent` - Numerical - Total descent during the activity
- `avg_stride_length` - Numerical - Average stride during the activity
- `avg_vertical_ratio` - Numerical - Average vertical ratio during the activity
- `avg_vertical_oscillation` - Numerical - Average vertical oscillation during the activity
- `avg__length` - Numerical - Average stride during the activity
- `avg__ground_contact_time` - Numerical - Average ground contact time during the activity
- `avg__power` - Numerical - Average power during the activity
- `max__power` - Numerical - Max power during the activity
- `steps` - Numerical - Steps taken during the activity
- `total_reps` - Numerical - Total repetitions during the activity
- `total_sets` - Numerical - Total sets during the activity
- `body_battery_drain` - Numerical - How much the activity drained my energy
- `best_lap_time` - Time - Best lap during the activity
- `number_of_laps` - Numerical - Number of laps during the activity
- `moving_time` - Time - Amount of time I move during the activity
- `elapsed_time` - Time - Elapsed time during the activity
- `min_elevation` - Numerical - Min elevation during the activity
- `max_elevation` - Numerical - Max elevation during the activity
