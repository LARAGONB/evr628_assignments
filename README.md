# **EVR 628 Assignments and more :)**

**Author:** Lina Arag칩n [linamaragonb\@gmail.com](mailto:linamaragonb@gmail.com){.email}

This repository has been created as part of the EVR 628 course (Introduction to Data Management and Visualization for Environmental Scientists) from the University of Miami. Here, I will upload my unique solutions for the assignments Dr. Juan Carlos Villase침or-Derbez (JC) designed.

## **First assignment**

The first assignment was to create this repository. So, Voila :) !!

When creating the project, I used the "EVR628tools" package designed by Dr. Villase침or-Derbez to make the project structure that will contain everything I will do to achieve each assignment's goal. I used the function create_dirs(), and with this one, I gave the repository the following structure:

-   `data`:

    -   `data/raw`:
    -   `data/processed`:

-   `scripts`:

    -   `scripts/01_processing`:
    -   `scripts/02_analyses`:
    -   `scripts/03_contents`: contains a single file showing the code to create this structure

-   `results`:

    -   `results/img`:
    -   `results/tab`:

The subfolder 03_processing, inside the scripts folder, contains the .qmd file showing the few steps I took for the first assignment.

## **Second assignment**

The second assignment is a bit more fun and interesting than the first one. For this one, we should find a messy dataset and shape it so that we are ready to analyze data and make figures.

I wanted to do something unrelated to my plant ecologist science hat. I have been working a lot analyzing pretty awesome data, so taking a break from that sounded like a great idea. Inspired by one of Dr. Villase침or-Derbez's suggestions, I decided to download the data my Garmin Venu 3S has been collecting since May 9, 2025.
