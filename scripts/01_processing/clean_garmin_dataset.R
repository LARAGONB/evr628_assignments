# 1. Load packages ----
pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "janitor", "lubridate")
lapply(pkgs, library, character.only = TRUE)
rm(pkgs)

# 2. Upload data ----
activities <- read_csv("data/raw/activities_garmin_20251028.csv")
head(activities)

# 3. Clean data ----
activities_clean <- activities |> 
  clean_names()

# 4. Get to know my data ----
dim(activities_clean)
colnames(activities_clean)

# 5. PROCESSING ----

# The data contains 194 activities (rows) and 42 columns
# The columns contain the name of the activity, time, date, as well as,
# body parameters collected by the watch during those.
# The data is tidier than what I was expecting (Well done :) Garmin).
# However, for the purpose of the class I should do something more than
# running the clean_names function. 
# I did notice that there are two columns associated with the activity's name
# The first column is the "activity_type" and the other one is the "title".
# The column title includes relevant information for running activities, 
# specifically the city in which I ran.
# So, I will create a new column named specific_info so that I can have just enough
# details of each activity.
# I haven't highlighted any of the activities as my favorite, then I will remove this column
# Additionally, I will split the date column in date and time, and afterwards I will split
# date into month, day, and year, using the function from the lubridate package.
# I also notices that columns that should be numerical (dbl) were recovered as characters. Therefore,
# I converted them to numeric columns

# Check unique values for activity type
unique(activities_clean$activity_type)

# Check unique values for title
unique(activities_clean$title)
